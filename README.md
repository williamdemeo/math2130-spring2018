equations, vector spaces, inner products, linear independence, dimension,
linear transformations, matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors
and diagonalization. Intended for students who do not plan to major in
Mathematics. Equivalent - Duplicate Degree Credit Not Granted: MATH 2135 or

**Remarks about office hours:**
The regularly scheduled office hours listed above are subject to change.
Changes will be announced during lecture. Office hours are the hours during
which I make a point of being available in my office to answer questions.
However, students are encouraged to stop by my office at anytime to see if I'm
available. It is helpful (but not required) to [send me an email](mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com)
in advance to let me know when you plan to visit.

Prerequisites
-------------
MATH 2300 or APPM 1360 (minimum grade C-)

--------------------------------------------------------

Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ **Final exam:** 30 points    
+ **Mid-term exams:** 40 points (20 each)    
+ **Homework:** 25 points  
+ **Quizzes:** 5 points

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted, depending on overall
student performance.  All curving (if any) will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    

----------------------------------------------------------

Homework
--------
Roughly weekly handwritten homework must be submitted at the
**beginning of lecture** on the scheduled due date.
No late homework is accepted. Each student's lowest homework score will
not count toward the final grade.

Quizzes and Exams
-----------------
There will be a number of quizzes, two midterm exams, and one final exam.

+ **EXAM 1: Monday, February 26, 9am** (on Chapters 1, 2)  
+ **EXAM 2: Wednesday, April 4, 9am** (on Chapters 3, 4)  
+ **FINAL EXAM: Saturday, May 5, 4--7:30pm** (Cumulative: Chs 1--6)

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
knowing the date of the final exam.

**There are no make-up quizzes or exams.** The lowest quiz score will be dropped.

----------------------------------------------------------

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty may be exacted if you have an excessive number of unexcused absences.
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total.

However, since Math 2130 is small, and since we will have occasional quizzes in this class,
attendance should not be an issue for most students.
Usually it only comes into play at the end of the semester if a student happens
to end up on the border between two letter grades.  In such cases, an exemplary
attendance record may help justify assigning the higher of the two grades.

**Important:** If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure
is to mention this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite
and disruptive to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings,
before the lecture is over.

--------------------------------------------------

Asking Questions
----------------

When you don't understand something, please ask a question!

1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **On Piazza.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion
   forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is designed to get you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com).

   Our class Piazza page is at: [Piazza][]

-----------------------------------------------------

Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 2130:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.

----------------------------------------

Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods,
tablets, microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.
Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for example, is totally
unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to focus on what is
being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting to other
students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to math is strictly prohibited.**

----------------------------------------------

Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy
will be referred to and dealt with in a manner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the university.


----------------------------------------------------------

Students With Disabilities
--------------------------
If you have a documented disability
or if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/)
for information on appropriate policies and procedures.

Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork
should be filed well before the first exam.**
